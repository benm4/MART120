The differences between GUI and CLI are quite big, for example GUI is a much slower software while CLI is much faster! GUI is so slow as it requires more memory because of 
all of the graphical components. Meanwhile CLI does not require very much memory. Slower is probably a deal breaker for some so if that's you CLI is the way to go! BUt if you're 
a begginner I'd reccommend GUI because it's less confusing and much more beginner friendly. CLI user needs to have a good knowledge of commands, etc.. and while CLI is not 
very flexible GUI is. There's plenty of small differences with both of these softwares and I listed just a few!
